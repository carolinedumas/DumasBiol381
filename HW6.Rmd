### 1. Assign to the variable n_dims a single random integer between 3 and 10.
```{r}
x <- 3:10 # vector from 3-10
n_dims <- sample(x=x, size=1) #randomly chooses one of the numbers in the vector x
print(n_dims)
```
#### Create a vector of consecutive integers from 1 to n_dims2
```{r}
y <- c(seq(from=1, to=n_dims^2)) # sequence to create vector 
print(y)
```
#### Use the sample function to randomly reshuffle these values.
```{r}
z <- sample(y) # sample randomly rearranges vector 
print(z)
```
#### Create a square matrix with these elements.
```{r}
z_matrix <- matrix(data=z, nrow=n_dims) # using n_dims as the nrow makes the matrix be the length of whatever the random number of n_dims 
print(z_matrix)
```
#### Find a function in r to transpose the matrix.
```{r}
z_transpose <- t(z_matrix)
print(z_transpose)
```
